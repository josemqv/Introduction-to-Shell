cut is a simple-minded command. In particular, it doesn't understand quoted strings. If, for example, your file is:

Name,Age
"Johel,Ranjit",28
"Sharma,Rupinder",26
then:

cut -f 2 -d , everyone.csv
will produce:

Age
Ranjit"
Rupinder"
rather than everyone's age, because it will think the comma between last and first names is a column separator.
