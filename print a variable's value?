A simpler way to find a variable's value is to use a command called echo, which prints its arguments. Typing

echo hello DataCamp!
prints

hello DataCamp!
If you try to use it to print a variable's value like this:

echo USER
it will print the variable's name, USER.

To get the variable's value, you must put a dollar sign $ in front of it. Typing

echo $USER
prints

repl

echo $OSTYPE
linux-gnu
