Another command that is often used with sort is uniq, whose job is to remove duplicated lines. More specifically, it removes adjacent duplicated lines. If a file contains:

2017-07-03
2017-07-03
2017-08-03
2017-08-03
then uniq will produce:

2017-07-03
2017-08-03
but if it contains:

2017-07-03
2017-08-03
2017-07-03
2017-08-03
cut -d , -f 2 seasonal/winter.csv | grep -v Tooth | sort | uniq -c
