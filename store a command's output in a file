if you run this command:

head -n 5 seasonal/summer.csv
it prints the first 5 lines of the summer data on the screen. 
If you run this command instead:

head -n 5 seasonal/summer.csv > top.csv
nothing appears on the screen. Instead, head's output is put in a new file called top.csv. 
You can take a look at that file's contents using cat:

cat top.csv
The greater-than sign > tells the shell to redirect head's output to a file. It isn't part of the head command;
instead, it works with every shell command that produces output.

tail -n 5 seasonal/winter.csv > last.csv
