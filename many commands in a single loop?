Printing filenames is useful for debugging, but the real purpose of loops is to do things with multiple files. This loop prints the second line of each data file:

for file in seasonal/*.csv; do head -n 2 $file | tail -n 1; done
It has the same structure as the other loops you have already seen: all that's different is that its body is a pipeline of two commands instead of a single command.

grep 2017-07 seasonal/winter.csv | tail -n 1

for file in seasonal/*.csv; do grep 2017-07 $file | tail -n 1; done
