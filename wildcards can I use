? matches a single character, so 201?.txt will match 2017.txt or 2018.txt, but not 2017-01.txt.
[...] matches any one of the characters inside the square brackets, so 201[78].txt matches 2017.txt or 2018.txt, but not 2016.txt.
{...} matches any of the comma-separated patterns inside the curly brackets, so {*.txt, *.csv} matches any file whose name ends with .txt or .csv
, but not files whose names end with .pdf.
